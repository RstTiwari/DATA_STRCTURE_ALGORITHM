# Concurrency

"""Concurrency refers to the ability of an operating system to handle multiple tasks at the same time. However,
it doesn't necessarily mean tasks are executed at the same time â€” they can be interleaved, where the CPU switches 
between tasks quickly to give the illusion of simultaneous execution."""
